          <p class="lead text-muted">Apollinaris: Academy of the Arcane</p>
          <p class="lead text-muted">I am working in a team of three (including myself) to make this visual novel, Apollinaris. We’re almost coming to the end of it now, and it’s been a real challenge for me as one of my weakest points has been dialogue. I wanted to really push myself out of my comfort zone in my final year of university and I love playing visual novels. </p>
          <p class="lead text-muted"> My visual novel love affair started with Hatoful Boyfriend, the pigeon dating sim. I’m a huge fan of birds, especially pigeons, so this game was a dream come true. And since playing that I had a real passion for wanting to make my own visual novel/dating sim. I loved the humour and the cute, quirky little characters and wanted to make my own. So, with the last year of university I decided to go for it and managed to convince my friends to join me.</p>
          <p class="lead text-muted"> We definitely over scoped our project at the start but I think we’ve got it down to an awesome cute little game now. Sure, with more people we could have made something with all the features we originally wanted, but we still have an in-depth game where conversations with characters actually mattered. And that’s something we’ve been aiming for from the very start.
          I think that the project has helped me to improve areas that I started off being weak in.
          </p>
          <p class="lead text-muted"> It has been a valuable learning experience, but has also brought a lot of laughs with it so it’s been a pleasure working on it.</p>
