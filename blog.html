            <p class="blog-post-meta">March 16, 2017</p>
            <p>So, I didn’t even hear anything about this game until a few days before its release when all of a sudden, crazy good reviews were appearing everywhere for it.</p>
            <p>I saw these and instantly thought “Wow! That game must be really awesome!” and I proceeded to pre-order it.</p>
            <p>One thing that instantly hit me when I started playing it was that it was incredibly beautiful. The characters and environments are so detailed. The first thing that annoyed me was about Rost, the protagonist, Aloy’s, father figure guy. I just straight up knew that he was going to die. It was so predictable and I kind of wish they had done something else with that. Also, killing off a bunch of potentially interesting characters right at the beginning was a bit lame to me. But, I tried to push past those minor annoyances and continue enjoying the game. </p>
            <p>It starts off with a lot of questions unanswered and it takes so long to get anywhere interesting and I think this was my main issue with the game in general.</p>
            <p>I absolutely love all the machines in the game and their different vulnerabilities and the fact you can override them and use some of them as mounts. Super cool! </p>
            <p>But the main story quests take so long to get interesting! And even when you’re finally given answers, it’s all a bit like ‘eh okay’. I really struggled even caring at the point where they finally start giving you some answers and I keep thinking to myself, am I just being harsh or am I just not really interested in this game.</p>
            <p>And the thing is, I was wildly guessing theories of where the game was going to go. I was so excited and then after playing 30 hours and starting to get fed up of the repetitive quests, the only comfort I got was from wandering around the map and appreciating the beautiful environments. And this suggests that there is most certainly some story pacing issues here.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Mass Effect: Andromeda</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">March 16, 2017</p>
            <p>The new Mass Effect comes out in a few days and I am very excited but also incredibly scared. The first BioWare game that I played was Dragon Age: Origins and I fell in love with that game completely. Then Dragon Age 2 came out and I enjoyed the story and the characters but the level design… Let’s not go into that now. Dragon Age Inquisition was kind of my last hope and it disappointed me on so many levels. And this order goes similarly with the Mass Effect series. The first one, I loved it. And Mass Effect 2 was great, I loved that one too. But then Mass Effect 3 came along and just ruined the scene (although EDI in a body was great). And now there is Mass Effect: Andromeda. A part of me is just excited because BioWare. A new Mass Effect game?! Sign me up! But another part of me is incredibly anxious about this game.</p>
              <p>If it goes great, then BioWare would have redeemed themselves slightly for the past few games that have just been a bit… Eh. And I’m wishing so hard that this game turns out good. But what if it’s bad? My friends keep sending me links to videos taking the piss out of the dialogue and the game hasn’t even been released yet. The dialogue I have seen is pretty bad, I’m not going to sugar coat it. But I’m still clinging on to hope that it’s just a bad bit in an overall amazing game. Please. Please.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">March 15, 2017</p>
            <p>This game has left me speechless. I haven’t had a chance to play it myself yet but I have been watching playthroughs and have read into it quite a bit. First of all, the art style is just so simple and appealing. But oh my, the design that has gone into this! And they’ve really hit the nail on the head with this one. And it’s so cute, the characters are just so adorable and wandering around the world itself is just so fulfilling. The hot and cold environments was an interesting thing to add and I feel like it gives the game a lot more immersion. You have to obtain outfits to brace against the cold or eat spicy food to keep you warm, again so cute! The physics in the game add so much depth, allowing the player to mess around with that. The shrines that contain puzzles are probably one of my favourite parts of the game, as some of them have some really interesting ways to solve them. </p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">DOTA 2</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">February 20, 2017</p>
            <p>I recently got back into playing MOBA’s. It’s been a while. I’m the kind of person that can’t deal with toxic players and after playing League of Legends for quite some time, I quit because the game made me so anxious.</p>
            <p>However, I have delved back into the wonderfully toxic world of MOBA’s to see if DOTA 2 is any better. And I can tell you, from my experience it is. Sure, there’s still a lot of toxic players but I generally just find the game more enjoyable than League of Legends.</p>
            <p>There seems to be a lot more mechanics in DOTA, which at first I was like ‘Ew why the hell can’t you recall’ and it took me a long time to get used to buying items and getting them delivered to me by the courier.</p>
            <p>But I’ve started to really enjoy it, and I’ve even just started playing ranked which is a big deal for me. I’ve never played competitively on any game before and I’m quite proud at myself for finally being able to play at a fairly skilled level.</p>
            <p>The balancing in MOBA’s always impresses me as well. Every patch that’s released changes the game completely and it’s so cool that they can do that.</p>
